# Python Basic Calculator - 30-Day Coding Challenge
**Day 8/30 (Restarted with Python focus after finishing my move cross country)**

This repository contains the code for a command-line calculator application as part of my 30-day coding challenge focused on building practical skills and a strong portfolio.

**Note:** Originally completed day 8 with a C# random password generator, but decided to pivot to Python for better web development opportunities. Starting fresh with Python fundamentals.

**Technologies Used:**
* Python
* Command Line Interface (CLI)

**Key Features:**
* Complete arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %, **)
* Natural expression input (e.g., "5 + 3 * 2")
* Decimal and integer number support
* Continuous calculation mode with clean interface
* Memory functionality (stores last result)
* Calculation history tracking
* Command support (history, clear, quit/exit)
* Robust error handling and input validation

**Learning Objectives:**
* Master Python syntax and basic data types
* Practice user input handling and control structures
* Implement proper error handling with try/except

**How to Run:**
* Clone the repository: `git clone [repository URL]`
* Navigate to the project directory: `cd python-basic-calculator`
* Run the calculator: `python main.py`
* Follow the on-screen prompts to perform calculations
